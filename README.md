# Pneumonia-detection-using-cnn
This repository contains code and resources for training a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset consisting of chest X-ray images labeled as either normal or pneumonia.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model can be obtained from Kaggle. It consists of a training set, a validation set, and a test set, with images classified into two categories: normal and pneumonia.

Dependencies
